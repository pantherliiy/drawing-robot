# drawing-robot

## Project description
A simple xy-plotter, using Arduino. A rail system with stepper motors will be used to move a pen holder in the x- and y-direction. The pen holder will be controlled by a servo motor so that the pen may be lifted off the paper when needed. Arduino will be used to controll the motors and draw an image.
